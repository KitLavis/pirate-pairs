## User Stories

## Project Aims

## UX

The keyword kept in mind during the design of the user interface was simplicity. Therefore every feature is clear, concise, and available on the same screen, so there is no need for the user to scroll. This simplicity in design allowed for responsiveness across all screen sizes to be achieved with minimal layout changes.

### Background and Colour Scheme

The over-arching colour scheme is also a matter of simplicity. Due to the varying shades of beige, cream and brown of the background image, black text was chosen as the main colour for text as it provides excellent contrast, great for ease of reading.

The background itself was chosen as the "aged-paper" asthetic gives the game a treasure map feel which is synoymous with pirates.

### Fonts/Typography

The main font used for everything bar the how-to popup is the 'Pirata One' font from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com).

As the how-to popup contains dense text, the 'Gill-sans' sans-serif font-family was used for ease of reading.
